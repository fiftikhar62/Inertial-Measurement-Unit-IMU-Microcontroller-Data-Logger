Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) & Microcontroller Data Logger

This project showcases a complete hardware and firmware design developed entirely in Altium Designer. It integrates an STM32F4 microcontroller with an MPU-6050 6-axis IMU to acquire and process real-time motion data. The board is USB-powered, making it a portable and versatile embedded solution.

Applications include motion tracking for balancing robots, quadcopters, and autonomous vehicles. The design demonstrates skills in PCB design, impedance control, embedded programming, and power management â€” covering the full journey from concept to implementation.
